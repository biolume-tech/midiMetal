// Declare a protocol named MIDIMessageDelegate. Protocols in Swift define a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. This particular protocol is designed for objects that will handle MIDI messages. The 'AnyObject' restriction means only class types can adopt this protocol, enabling weak references to the delegate to avoid retain cycles.
protocol MIDIMessageDelegate: AnyObject {
    // Define a method in the protocol that any delegate conforming to this protocol must implement. This method is intended to be called when a MIDI message is received, carrying details of the MIDI channel, control change (CC) number, and its value. Each parameter is a UInt8, reflecting the byte-based nature of MIDI messages.
    func didReceiveMIDIMessage(channel: UInt8, ccNumber: UInt8, value: UInt8)
}

// Define a class named MIDIController. Classes in Swift are general-purpose, flexible constructs that become the building blocks of your programâ€™s code. This class is designed to manage MIDI interactions, such as receiving MIDI messages from devices.
class MIDIController {
    // Define a variable midiClient of type MIDIClientRef, initialized to 0. MIDIClientRef is a type alias for an integer that represents a reference to a CoreMIDI client object, which is an application's access point to the MIDI system.
    var midiClient: MIDIClientRef = 0
    // Define a variable midiInPort of type MIDIPortRef, also initialized to 0. MIDIPortRef is a type alias for an integer that represents a reference to a MIDI port, used here to specify an input port through which MIDI messages are received.
    var midiInPort: MIDIPortRef = 0

    private func setupMIDI() {
        // Create a MIDI client with a specific name ('MetalMIDIClient'). The MIDIClientCreate function takes four parameters: the name of the client, a pointer to a callback function for notifying the client of changes in the MIDI setup (unused here, hence nil), a context pointer for the callback (also nil here), and a reference to the MIDIClientRef variable where the newly created client reference will be stored.
        let statusClient = MIDIClientCreate("MetalMIDIClient" as CFString, nil, nil, &midiClient)

        guard statusClient == noErr else { return }
        
        // Create a MIDI input port for the client. The MIDIInputPortCreate function is called with the client reference, a name for the port ('MetalMIDIIn'), a callback function (midiInputCallback) where incoming MIDI messages will be delivered, a context pointer passed to the callback (a reference to 'self' here, to allow the callback to access this instance of MIDIController), and a reference to the MIDIPortRef variable where the newly created port reference will be stored.
        let statusPort = MIDIInputPortCreate(midiClient, "MetalMIDIIn" as CFString, midiInputCallback, Unmanaged.passUnretained(self).toOpaque(), &midiInPort)

        // Iterate through all MIDI sources (devices that can send MIDI messages) available in the system. MIDIGetNumberOfSources() returns the number of sources, and a for loop is used to go through each source by its index.
        (0..<MIDIGetNumberOfSources()).forEach { index in
            // Retrieve a reference to the MIDI source at the given index. MIDIGetSource(index) returns the MIDIEndpointRef for the source, which uniquely identifies a MIDI endpoint.

            // Connect the previously created input port to this MIDI source, enabling the application to receive messages from the source. MIDIPortConnectSource takes the input port reference, the source endpoint reference, and a context pointer (nil in this case since it's not used).

// Define the midiInputCallback function, which is called by the CoreMIDI system when MIDI messages are received through the input port. The function signature matches what CoreMIDI expects for input port callbacks, with parameters for the packet list (containing MIDI messages), and two context pointers.

        let bytes = Mirror(reflecting: packet.data).children
        // Map the reflected children to an array of UInt8, which are the actual MIDI message bytes.
        let data = bytes.map { $0.value as! UInt8 }
        // Extract the MIDI status byte from the first byte of the message. This byte contains both the type of MIDI message and the channel number.
        let status = data[0]
        // Isolate the channel number from the status byte. MIDI channels are 0-15, but they are encoded in the lower 4 bits of the status byte, so we use bitwise AND with 0x0F.
        let channel = status & 0x0F

        DispatchQueue.main.async {

            // Call the delegate's didReceiveMIDIMessage method, passing the channel, CC number, and value extracted from the MIDI message.
